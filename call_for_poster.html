                <li>Agent-based design optimization across the EDA pipeline, including HLS, RTL/logic synthesis, and physical design;</li>
                <li>Agents for code generation, transformation, analysis, and reasoning in chip design workflows;</li>
                <li>Agents for digital logic (ASICs and FPGAs), analog, mixed-signal, and RF IC designs;</li>
                <li>Multi-agent system design and collaborative problem solving in chip design;</li>
                <li>Training or post-training of large foundation models for specialization in chip design;</li>
