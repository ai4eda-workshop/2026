            <h3>Towards Self-evolving LLM Multi-Agent System for Automated RTL Design and Verification</h3>
            
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>The semiconductor industry faces increasing challenges in design automation as traditional ML-based tools operate in isolation across design phases, lacking intelligent coordination between specification input, RTL generation, and verification. Moreover, current methodologies are hindered by a critical verification bottleneck, where manual testbench generation consumes 60-70% of development time, and LLM-generated RTL achieves only 28.37% success rates for sequential circuits due to insufficient corner-case coverage. To address these challenges, we are developing an LLM-powered multi-agent system that integrates specification input, RTL design, testing, verification, validation, and optimization. This talk will present our recent progress on such agentic and training frameworks. MAGE, the first open-source and state-of-the-art multi-agent system for Verilog RTL generation, employs specialized agents with novel sampling and validation techniques that achieve 95.7% correctness on VerilogEval V2 benchmarks. Pro-V-R1, the first of its kind reasoning enhanced autonomous agent for testbench generation and hardware verification, with (i) a modular agentic system that couples LLM-based reasoning with programmatic tool use for RTL verification, (ii) a data construction pipeline leveraging existing RTL datasets to build simulation-validated, expert-level trajectories tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) RTL verification agents and (iii) an efficient GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm using verification-specific rewards derived from program-tool feedback to optimize the end-to-end verification workflow. I will also share insights gained from our studies on LLM's capabilities and multi-agent system-based learning in addressing complex real-world challenges.</p>
